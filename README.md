# Proof 

## Overview
This is a math game I designed for my second grade daughter to help her with her homework. I noticed she was experiencing some difficulty with carrying over and borrowing. The intent of this app was to provide her with a way she could practice in a game format so she didn't realize she was doing "schoolwork". Since kids love to use the things that they design, I included her in the design sessions in order to peek her interest in using the game and...possibly even computer programming. :)

### Current Features

  * Deployment to multiple Platforms
  
  * Multiplication
  
  * Division
  
  * Hinting - field level validation

### Tech Notes.
* I wanted to check out react/redux design pattern and thought my daughters math homework would make for a nice sample project to implement this design pattern. I found a lot of React/Redux boilerplate applications out there but decided on  the React Redux Starter Kit from David Zukowski. https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit.git. It is light weight and to the point.
